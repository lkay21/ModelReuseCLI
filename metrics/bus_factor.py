def bus_factor(owner: str, repo: str) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the bus factor of a repository.
    The bus factor is defined as the minimum number of developers that need to be incapacitated
    (e.g., hit by a bus) before the project is in serious trouble.

    Sort contributors by commits, add them up until you cover at least 50% of total commits.
    The bus factor is then the number of contributors needed to reach that 50% threshold divided by
    the total number of contributors.

    Args:
        owner (str): The owner of the repository.
        repo (str): The repository identifier.

    Returns:
        float: The bus factor of the repository. [0-1]
